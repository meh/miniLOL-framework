The miniLOL framework
=====================

The system parts of miniLOL are becoming more and more and I'm starting to need them even outside
of miniLOL, so here it is, some miniLOL stuff usable out of context.

It's obviously based on link:http://prototypejs.org[Prototype] and extends it with some useful stuff
(useful to meh :).

Use _miniLOL-framework.full.js_ to get the package with Prototype and miniLOL-framework both minified.

Use _miniLOL-framework.js_ if you want to use another Prototype source.
